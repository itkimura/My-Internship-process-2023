# How to make your job application stand out
I started studying at **Hive Helsinki** in Augst in 2021 and succeeded to have a Software Engineer Internship in Summer in 2023.
From my experience, here are some tips to help making your job application stand out to get an internship in Helsinki. This article is written especially for Hivers, however still usable for eveyone. 

# CV

## Do you descibe yourself in your own words?
Do not copy and paste examples, **use your own words to describe yourself.** For example, many people only give a general description of their experience and do not tell what kind of work they have actually done.

For example, suppose you had work experience as a cashier.
A general description would be like this.
```
- Handle cash, credit, or check transactions with customers
- Scan goods and collect payments
```
This only describes the work of a cashier, and does not describe what work you yourself have done.
You should explain your work experience in your own words like example below.
```
- Handle cashir tasks efficiently and provide friendly customer service
- Cooperate with colleagues to ensure that there are no errors in daily work.
```
This way, the recruiter can see that you are hard worker, friendly, collaborative etc. Wording is important.

## Format matters
You don't need to be a graphic designer, however think about readability. Important text should be large and written in top, detailed explanations should be small, use a list if you have several explanations.

### Example I

### Example II

**This is a small change, however, the eye-catchy documents are more likely to impress recruiters.**

# Cover Letter

The same as CV, do not copy and paste examples, **use your own words to describe yourself.**
For example, answer questions below.
- [ ] What do you study in Hive? <sub>Do not explain what Hive is, more important to tell how & what you study!</sub>
- [ ] What kind of projects have you done? <sub>More detail about your study.</sub>
- [ ] What kind of technical skills do you have?
- [ ] Which computer language do you enjoy using?
- [ ] **What do you want to learn as a trainee?** <sub>This is the most important question what recruiters would like to know</sub>
- [ ] Why do you apply to the company specifically? <sub>Better to have different reason for each company</sub>

If you use example text from internet, it sounds boaring and recruiters would not be interested in. You should explain your personality, your siklls, your experience in your own words.
