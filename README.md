# How to make your job application stand out
I started studying at Hive Helsinki in August 2021 and succeeded to have a Software Engineer Internship in the Summer of 2023. From my experience, here are some tips to help make your job application stand out to get an internship in Helsinki. This article is written especially for Hivers, yet still usable for everyone.

# CV

## Do you describe yourself in your own words?
Do not copy and paste examples, **use your own words to describe yourself.** Many people only give a general description of their experience and do not tell what kind of work they have actually done.

For example, suppose you had work experience as a cashier.
A general description would be like this.
```
- Handle cash, credit, or check transactions with customers
- Scan goods and collect payments
```
This only describes the work of a cashier and does not describe what work you have done. You should explain your work experience in your own words like in the example below.
```
- Handle cashir tasks efficiently and provide friendly customer service
- Cooperate with colleagues to ensure that there are no errors in daily work.
```
This way, the recruiter can see that you are a hard worker, friendly, collaborative etc. The wording is important.

## Format matters
You don't need to be a  graphic designer, yet, think about readability. Important text should be large and written on top, detailed explanations should be small, and use a list if you have several explanations.

### Example I

### Example II

**This is a small change though, the eye-catchy documents are more likely to impress recruiters.**

# Cover Letter

The same as CV, do not copy and paste examples, **use your own words to describe yourself.**
For example, answer questions below.
- What do you study in Hive? <sub>Do not explain what Hive is too much, more important to tell how & what you study!</sub>
- What kind of projects have you done? <sub>More detail about your study.</sub>
- What kind of technical skills do you have?
- Which computer language do you enjoy using?
- **What do you want to learn as a trainee?** <sub>This is the most important question that recruiters would like to know</sub>
- Why do you apply to the company specifically? <sub>Better to have a different reasons for each company</sub>

If you use example text from the internet, it sounds boring and recruiters would not be interested in you. You should explain your personality, your skills, and your experience in your own words. The number of words that can be written in a cover letter is limited, so saying the same thing over and over again should be avoided.

## Paragraph of cover letter
Create an outline for your cover letter. Before you begin writing your cover letter, use an outline to plan out what you want to say in each of your paragraphs. Number your paragraphs 1â€“3 and jot down a phrase or sentence that sums up the major point you want to make in that paragraph. 
If you write the cover letter without outlining, the essay will be poorly organized.

For example:

```
[Introduction]
- Where you are appling
[Body]
- Your study and skills
- Job experience or coding projects which you would like to highlight
- Your personality
[Conclusion]
- Why you applied to this position
```
