# My Internship application experience in 2023
I started studying at Hive Helsinkiüêù in August 2021 and got a Software Engineer Internship position in the summer of 2023. I decided to write about my experience and some tips to get an internship in Helsinki.
This article is written primarily for Hivers, yet it is still usable for everyone.

**Disclaimer: This article doesn't guarantee that you will get an internship. This is just my own experience.üôè**

## My plan to apply for internships
I started applying in Nov 2023. I tried to apply at least 1 position per week, so 4 positions in a month. I wanted to apply carefully for each application, so I set aside a certain amount of time for each application. Some applications require assignments, technical tests, or video Interviews beforehand. So I felt busy with even four applications in a month as I was doing school projects at the same time. It was not easy to keep applying at the same time studying at Hive. However many summer internship application processes start between Nov and April, so I recommend applying in Nov or earlier. There are not many open positions during summer.
## All application result
I applied for 21 positions in total. It resulted in 
- 16 rejections on my CV
- 2 rejections on final interviews
- 2 offers

I think it is important to establish trends and countermeasures in job hunting. I searched each company and its products and wrote specifically why I would like to work there in the cover letter. I also asked my friends to review my application before applying and got advice for improvement before sending. I analyzed what was missing and how I could do better next time when I got a rejection. As a result, the quality of each application has improved and resulted in a better outcome. I was also lucky too‚úåÔ∏è
